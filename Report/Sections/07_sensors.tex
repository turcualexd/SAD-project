\section{Sensors}
\label{subsec:sensors}

Sensors are fundamental tools that allows the SC to know its orientation or angular velocity. Their presence onboard 
is fundamental for having a controlled motion of the satellite. In this section, the 3 sensors used will be presented, 
it will be also clarified the motivation that lead the team to choose two additional sensors over the horizon sensor 
assigned. 

\subsection{Horizon Sensor}
Horizon sensors are devices that can detect the centre of the planet, in our case Earth, and reconstruct the direction 
of that point with respect to the satellite. They usually work by analyzing the IR spectrum of the image through a thermopile
to reduce the visible light spectrum interference caused by transition of day and night on earth. 
Due to the nadir pointing requirment a static earth sensor has been chosen for this specific application. In particular, the 
\textit{Meisei Earth Horizon} was chosen, which has the following specifics:

    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    $\bm{F.O.V. \, [\deg]}$ & $\bm{Accuracy \, [\deg]}$ & $\bm{Frequency \, [Hz]}$ \\
    \hline
    $33$ & $1$ & $30$  \\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}

\end{table}

Due to operational requirements, the static sensor has to point the Earth, in particular the optical
axis must have the same direction of the nadir (direction that links centre of earth and CoM of the S/C).
To fulfill this request, a good option could be to position the sensor on the face that also contains the 
payload, that is the face of the spacecraft main body (cube) that has normal along the $\boldsymbol{x_b}$ 
direction. The model implemented to simulate the behaviour of the sensor in the Simulink environment, 
was to take the real position of the S/C with respect to centre of Earth expressed in inertial space, change its
direction multiplying by -1 and express it in the $\mathcal{B}$ frame through the real attitude matrix $\boldsymbol{A_{B,N}}$. 
This unit vector is the input of the sensor block, here it is sampled through a zero-order hold of frequency specified by
\autoref{table:Hor_sensor} to simulate the digital nature of the sensor. Then some errors of measurments has to be added.
It was decided to model two typical effects of real sensor: the mounting error that cause misalignment and also an 
accuracy error modeled with a band-limited white noise on all the components of the direction vector.
