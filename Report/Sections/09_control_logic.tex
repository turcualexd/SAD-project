\subsection{De-tumbling phase: the B-dot control}
\label{subsec:detumbling}
The De-tumbling phase is performed immediately after the release of the spacecraft by the launcher, at this moment the angular velocities are random and depends
on the launcher motion, also the attitude is initally unknown. In order to make the satellite ready to enter in the operational regime, so that it can start the 
pointing of the sensor's targets and the payload, the spacecraft must be de-tumbled. This means to create a control that decelerate the rotational velocities and 
fetch them to arbitrarly small values. 

A frequently adopted option on magnetic-actuated satellites is to implement the so-called \textit{B-dot control}, this method allows to exploit magnetic measurments 
to produce a direct magnetic dipole command to the magnetorquer which at the end leads to arbitrarly small values of $\omega$. The increasing interest on this kind of
control law is due to the fact that magnetorquers posses very intersting propreties, such as \cite{bdot}: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item absence of catastrophic failure modes (an example of this would be the RW actuators which were characterized by catastrophic failure due to electrostatic charge on the bearing);
    \item reliable architecture which leads to unlimited operational life;
    \item the possibility to smoothly modulate the control torque, without inducing coupling with flexible modes (when bang-bang techniques are not adopted);
    \item significant savings in terms of weight and complexity since no moving parts are present.
\end{itemize}
Instead, the major drawback of this kind of system is surely the underactuated property. In general the magnetorquer cannot provide an arbitrarly
oriented control torque due to the physical law that rules this device.

\begin{empheq}{equation}
    \boldsymbol{M_c}  = \boldsymbol{D} \times \boldsymbol{B}_B
\end{empheq}

Clearly, it doesn't exist a $\boldsymbol{D}$ that satisfies the above equation if $\boldsymbol{M_c}$ and $\boldsymbol{B}$ are parallel. 
This implies to have, in general, a system that is not controllable at every istant, but it is in an averaged-sense.
This implies a major difficulty in implementing a solely magnetic-actuated microsatellite. Avanzini et al. \cite{bdot} demonstrate that asympotitc stability can 
be obtained through a law of this kind (using only magnetorquer and a magnetometer):

\begin{empheq}{equation}
    \label{eq:ctrl_bdot}
    \boldsymbol{D} = - \frac{k_{\omega}}{\lVert \boldsymbol{B}_B \rVert} \dot{\hat{\boldsymbol{B}}}\boldsymbol{_B}
\end{empheq}

The idea of this kind of command is that the variation in magnetic field $\boldsymbol{B}$ in the $\mathcal{B}$ frame can be written as:

\begin{empheq}{equation}
    \label{eq:b_dot}
    \dot{\boldsymbol{B}}_B = \frac{d\left( \boldsymbol{A}_{B,N}\boldsymbol{B}_N \right)}{dt} = 
    \dot{\boldsymbol{A}}_{B,N}\boldsymbol{B}_N + \boldsymbol{A}_{B,N}\dot{\boldsymbol{B}}_N \approx \dot{\boldsymbol{A}}_{B,N}\boldsymbol{B}_N 
    = - \left[ \boldsymbol{\omega} \times \right]\boldsymbol{A}_{B,N} \boldsymbol{B}_N = - \left[ \boldsymbol{\omega} \times \right]\boldsymbol{B}_B
\end{empheq}

The approximation symbol is due to the fact that when $\omega >> 1$, the variation of the magnetic field vector in $\mathcal{B}$ frame is mainly 
due to the rotation of the frame and less due to the changing of $\boldsymbol{b}_N$ (that is caused by the evolution in he orbital position and other slow
variations due to geomagnetic field). With the above equation it has been demonstrated that $\boldsymbol{\omega}$ and $\dot{\boldsymbol{B}}$ are strictly related, so making the control
law proportional to $\dot{\boldsymbol{B}}$ would be similar to make it proportional to $\boldsymbol{\omega}$ (like the 'standard' de-tumbling law). 
This mathematical considerations imply that for a detumbling law, it could be sufficient to have a magnetometer and a magnetorquer without a direct measurment of the angular
velocity obtained by a gyro. Another positive consequence of having a proportional law that produces directly a magnetic dipole $\boldsymbol{D}$, is that the command is directly 
make as an input of the actuator (without inverting any actuator law). It is important to underline that this kind of law would work at his best when angular velocity is high 
enough to make the assumption of \autoref{eq:b_dot} true. 
In theory the acutated torque is:
\begin{empheq}{equation}
    \label{eq:m_c}
    \boldsymbol{M_c} = - \frac{k_{\omega}}{\lVert \boldsymbol{B}_B \rVert} \dot{\hat{\boldsymbol{B}}}\boldsymbol{_B}\times \boldsymbol{B_B} 
\end{empheq}
also notice that when $\omega >> 1$ \autoref{eq:b_dot} is more and more true, and so $\boldsymbol{B}_B$ and $\dot{\hat{\boldsymbol{B}}}\boldsymbol{_B}$ are perpendicular, resulting 
in the maximum actuable control torque.

Regarding the control law \autoref{eq:ctrl_bdot}, it has to be seen that the vector derived is not the derivative of the magnetic field vector, but it is the derivative of the unit vector of the 
direction of the magnetic field. Also, notice that all the vector in the above relationship are in the $\mathcal{B}$ frame since the magnetic 
field vector $\boldsymbol{B}$ comes from the magnetometer measurment.

In the context of the simulation environment on Simulink, the formulation choosen for the b-dot control comes from \cite{bdot} of Avanzini et Al. Some precaution has to be taken
when implementing the law, since the numerical derivative of a mesaured (hence noisy) signal has to be performed. This inconvinence can be overcome by using a low-pass filter \cite{crass_book}.
In order to make some sense out of the calculation, a discrete low-pass Butterworth filter of the 1st order has been used just after the discrete derivative block. 
Setting the cut-off frequency on 0.06 rad/s the signal is pretty clean and the results of simulation are coherent
